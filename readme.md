Welcome to my **Unosquare member path repository.** 

Here you will find all the **documentation/notes/excersices/projects** related with my **learning path.**

Each learning topic should have a folder (E.g. "Functional Programming") and some subfolders according the activities I do for that module. The folders structure could change but they must be almost the same.
