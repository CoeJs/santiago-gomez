# Referential Transparency

We have been getting close of the definition of what a ***pure function*** is, but to be completely clear the full definition is that **a function call is pure if it has *referential transparency.***

***Referential transparency*** means, a function call can be replaced with it's return value and not affect any of the rest of the program.
