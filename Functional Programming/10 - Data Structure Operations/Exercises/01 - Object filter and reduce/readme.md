# Data Structures (And FP Review!)

This is an exercise to practice list-operations (map/filter/reduce) on more general data structures. We also revisit a variety of previous FP concepts (point-free, currying, etc).

## Instructions (Part 1)

1. Familiarize yourself with the provided utilities and helpers, like `listSum(..)`, `listProduct(..)`, `mapObj(..)`, etc.

2. Find the `// TODO` comments to implement both `filterObj(..)` and `reduceObj(..)`. The fixed exercise should now print `38886` to the console.
